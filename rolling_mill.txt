The task is to develop a set of classes to check the quality of metal sheets.

Assume a rolling mill that produces metal sheets. The sheets are of a rectangular shape, we measure the width and length. Moreover, the thickness of the plate is measured in a regular square grid. Assume an example sheet with dimensions width=10 and length=20. There will be a total of 200 measured values, each representing the thickness of a single square in the grid.

The quality of the produced sheet is measured by various criteria. We want to cut a rectangle as big as possible such that it matches the following:

    relDev - we want to find the biggest rectangular sheet where the standard deviation of the thickness divided by the average thickness (relative deviation) is smaller or equal to some given threshold,
    volume - we want to find the biggest rectangular sheet where the volume is smaller than the given threshold,
    minMax - we want to find the biggest rectangular sheet where any measured thickness fits into the given range of values.

A metal sheet is represented by an instance of class CSheet. The class contains member variables describing the metal sheet (width, length, and an array of thickness values). Moreover, there are 3 arrays/maps filled with relDev/volume/minMax thresholds. The arrays/maps are to be filled with the computed area of the rectangles.

The metal sheets instances are read from a rolling mill (CProductionLine). This class provides methods to read the sheets (getSheet) and submit the filled sheets (doneSheet). Your implementation will communicate with the rolling mill by means of two dedicated communication threads (two communication threads per CProductionLine instance). One thread enters a loop where it repeatedly calls method getSheet, the second thread will similarly call method doneSheet to submit the computed sheets. The communication threads are intended to only communicate with the rolling mill. These threads are not intended to solve the problems (the computation may take long time, leaving the rolling mill without service). Since the rolling mill cannot change the order of the metal sheets it produces, the computed sheets must be submitted in the same order they were read. It is possible to read and work on multiple sheets at a moment (in fact, it is the recommended scenario), however, the CSheet instances must be passed to doneSheet in the same order they were read from getSheet.

The computation is encapsulated in a CQualityControl instance. This class is given the references to the individual rolling mills, it controls the execution, and it manages the worker threads. As stated above, the computation of the relDev/volume/minMax problems may be very expensive. Communication threads are not intended to actually do the computation. Therefore, there will be dedicated worker threads that do the expensive computation job, leaving the communication threads free for the service of CProductionLine. A communication thread reads a CSheet instance from getSheet. The instance is passed to the worker threads, these threads compute the required relDev/volume/minMax problems. Once the sheet computation is finished, the completed CSheet instance is passed to the communication thread that serves method doneSheet of the originating rolling mill. The communication thread is responsible for the order of the sheets (we need to preserve the same order given by the reading) and calls the doneSheet method when appropriate. The number of worker threads is controlled by an external parameter, thus the computation load may be adjusted to the hardware capabilities (# of CPUs).

The following scenario describes the expected use of class CQualityControl:

    a new instance of CQualityControl is created,
    the rolling mills are created and registered (method addLine),
    the computation is started (method start). The method is given the number of worker thread in its parameter. Method CQualityControl::start runs the worker threads, and lets them wait for the work. Next, it runs the communication threads (two communication threads per registered rolling mill) and lets them serve the mills. Once all threads are initialized, the method returns to its caller,
    the communication threads receive the sheets from the mills (getSheet) and pass them to the worker threads. When getSheet returns an empty smart pointer, the corresponding rolling mill is not going to provide any further problems and the communication thread may leave the loop and terminate,
    worker thread accept problems from the communication threads and solve them. When solved, the problems are passed back to the originating rolling mill (where the second communication thread returns them),
    the second communication thread receives the solved instance of CSheet and returns it to the rolling mill (method doneSheet). The solved sheets must be returned immediately when possible (have to care about the order). In particular, you cannot save the received problems in an array and return all of them in a batch at the end of the computation. the submitting communication thread terminates when the last CSheet instance is returned to the rolling mill,
    the testing environment calls CQualityControl::stop. This call may be invoked at any moment, often even in middle of the computation. Method CQualityControl::stop waits until all sheets are processed, all threads are terminated and returns to the caller,
    CQualityControl instance is freed.

The classes and interfaces:

    CSheet is a class that represents a single metal sheet. It aggregates the dimensions, the measured thickness values, and the problems to compute. The class is implemented in the testing environment, you are not allowed to modify it in any way. The interface is:
        m_Width the width of the metal sheet,
        m_Length the length of the metal sheet,
        m_Thickness an array of measured thickness values. There is a total of m_Width × m_Length values, the values are stored in the row-major order. That is, the values correspond to 2D indices [0][0] [0][1] [0][2] ... [0][m_Width-1] [1][0] [1][1] [1][2] ... [1][m_Width - 1] ... [m_Length-1][0] ... [m_Length-1][m_Width-1].
        m_RelDev a list of pairs that define relDev problems. There may exist many elements in the list, each element represent a single relDev problem to solve. The first component of the pair is a threshold (maximum relative deviation), the second field is set to zero. Your implementation solves the problem and fills in the area into the second field,
        m_Volume is a map of values that define volume problems. Each key in the map represents a single problem instance, the key is the volume threshold. The values are initialized to zeros. Your implementation solves the problem and stores the area into the value,
        m_MinMax is a map of values that define minMax problems. Each key in the map represents a single problem instance, the key is an instance of CRange (a pair of integers defining the limits). The values are initialized to zeros. Your implementation solves the problem and stores the area into the value,
        there are some auxiliary methods that simplify the handling of the lists/maps, see the attached code.
    CProductionLine is a class that represents a rolling mill. The class is an abstract class, the actual implementation is hidden in the testing environment (i.e., your program will communicate wit a subclass of CProductionLine). The interface is fixed, you cannot modify it in any way. The class provides methods:
        getSheet to read the next metal sheet from the rolling mill. The method returns a smart pointer encapsulating CSheet instance, or an empty smart pointer to indicate that there are no any further metal sheets to process (the last metal sheet produced by this rolling mill). The call may block for a rather long time, therefore, you must call this method from a dedicated communication thread. The communication thread is expected to call this method in a loop and it is expected to pass the received metal sheets to the worker threads. The testing environment tests that this method is called by exactly one communication thread. That is, for each instance of CProductionLine, there must exist a dedicated communication thread that calls this method,
        doneSheet is a method to pass the computed instance of CSheet back to the rolling mill. The parameter is the filled instance previously read from getSheet. The processing in doneSheet may block for a rather long time, therefore, each instance of CProductionLine must start a dedicated communication thread that receives solved problems from the worker threads and passes them to the rolling mill. The testing environment tests that this method is called by exactly one communication thread. That is, for each instance of CProductionLine, there must exist a dedicated communication thread that calls this method. The communication thread must take care of the order the solved instances are passed to the rolling mill. The rolling mill expects the computed sheets in the same order they were generated from getSheet.
    CQualityControl is an encapsulating class. You are expected to develop the class and implement the required interface:
        a default constructor to initialize the instance. The constructor is not expected to start any threads,
        method addLine (x), the method adds a new instance of the rolling mill,
        method start ( workThr ), the method starts the communication and worker threads. Once the threads are started, method start returns to the caller,
        method stop, the method waits until all sheets (from all rolling mills) are processed and terminates all threads. Finally, it returns to the caller,
        static method checkAlgorithm(sheet). The method is intended to check the correctness of the computation algorithms. A parameter to this call is an instance of CSheet with several relDev/volume/minMax problems to solve. The method sequentially solves the problems and fills the result in the CSheet instance. This method is also used to calibrate the speed of your implementation. The testing environment measures the speed is used to modify the size of the problems it generates.
    function maxRectByRelDev (thickness, width, height, relDevMax) is a ready-made implementation of the algorithm to solve one relDev problem. The parameters are the 2D array of thickness values, the dimensions of the sheet, and the threshold of the relative deviation. Return value is the area of the biggest rectangle such that the relative thickness deviation is at most relDevMax. Your implementation may use this function or you may decide to implement the computation yourself. The provided implementation is disabled in the bonus tests where it returns zero.
    function maxRectByVolume (thickness, width, height, volumeMax) is a ready-made implementation of the algorithm to solve one volume problem. The parameters are the 2D array of thickness values, the dimensions of the sheet, and the threshold of the volume. Return value is the area of the biggest rectangle such that the volume is at most volumeMax. Your implementation may use this function or you may decide to implement the computation yourself. The provided implementation is disabled in the bonus tests where it returns zero.
    function maxRectByMinMax (thickness, width, height, min, max) is a ready-made implementation of the algorithm to solve one minMax problem. The parameters are the 2D array of thickness values, the dimensions of the sheet, and the low and high limits of the thickness. Return value is the area of the biggest rectangle such that all thickness values fit into the range min to max (both inclusive). Your implementation may use this function or you may decide to implement the computation yourself. The provided implementation is disabled in the bonus tests where it returns zero.

Your implementation may either use the provided function for the computation, or you may implement the computation yourself. You have to implement the computation if you try to pass the bonus tests. The following advice may be helpful:

    relDev problem:
        the naive algorithm has to try all existing (sub)rectangles of the sheet, there is O((m_Width × m_Length)2) such subrectangles,
        then compute the average thickness and the standard deviation with O (m_Width × m_Length) operations,
        finally, divide the standard deviation with the average and compare it with the threshold. Caution, floating point numbers are compared, you need to add some tolerance. Since we already compare relative values, the tolerance may be set to a fixed number. The reference uses 1e-5,
        the naive solution above results in time complexity O((m_Width × m_Length)3),
        function maxRectByRelDev has complexity of O((m_Width × m_Length)2) (n4 for square shaped inputs).
    volume problem:
        the naive algorithm has to try all existing (sub)rectangles of the sheet, there is O((m_Width × m_Length)2) such subrectangles,
        compute the volume of each such (sub)rectangle simply as the sum of measured thickness values, the sum takes O (m_Width × m_Length)) operations,
        compare the sum with the threshold,
        naive algorithm results in complexity O ( (m_Width × m_Length)3),
        function maxRectByVolume has complexity of O (m_Width × m_Length × min (m_Width, m_Length)) (n3 for square shaped inputs).
    minMax problem:
        the naive algorithm has to try all existing (sub)rectangles of the sheet, there is O((m_Width × m_Length)2) such subrectangles,
        compare each value in the (sub)rectangle with the limits, this takes O (m_Width × m_Length) operations,
        thus the naive algorithm time complexity is O ( (m_Width × m_Length)3 ),
        function maxRectByMinMax has time complexity of (m_Width × m_Length) (n2 for square shaped inputs),
        the optimization is based on the idea here.
    If you decide to implement the algorithms by yourself, your implementation should be reasonably efficient, i.e., the complexity of your implementation should be comparable to the complexity of the provided functions. The testing environment does a calibration of the algorithm and modifies the size of the problems to solve. The calibration may compensate the hidden multiplicative constants, however, there are definitely some limits. For example, naive solution with time complexity O((m_Width × m_Length)3) is not likely to pass.
    Please note that the time complexities of the problems range from O(n4) to O(n2). there will be fewer You may expect relDev problems than minMax problems in a CSheet instance, however, it does not need to be true. Your implementation should assign the problems to the worker threads such that all available computational power is used efficiently.
